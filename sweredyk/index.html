            <h2>Who is Steve Weredyk?</h2>
            <p>
                Stephen J. Weredyk was born and raised in Camden, New Jersey. Stephen moved to Philadelphia when he was 17 to attend the University of the Arts, where he received his BFA in animation in 1997. On his graduation day, he was offered a job at CoreStates Financial Corp., where he worked as a Multimedia Producer. One year later, he made the big move to New York City and began working for Wenner Media, parent company of Rolling Stone, Us Weekly, and Men’s Journal.

                During his 5 years at Wenner, Stephen rose through the ranks from Marketing Associate to Multimedia Director and revolutionized the way advertising space was sold by replacing PowerPoint with high-tech multimedia presentations. In his time at Wenner, Stephen worked closely with both advertising and editorial on a multitude of creative projects.

                In 2003, Stephen accepted an offer at Bauer Publishing as Corporate Art Director and was promoted 2 years later to Executive Director of Creative Services, which is his current position.

                Stephen currently resides in Long Island with his wife, son and daughter.
